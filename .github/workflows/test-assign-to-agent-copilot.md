# Assign to Agent Test Workflow

This workflow tests the `assign_to_agent` safe output feature, which allows AI agents to assign GitHub Copilot agents to issues.

## Task

**For workflow_dispatch:**
Assign the Copilot agent to issue #${{ github.event.inputs.issue_number }} using the `assign_to_agent` tool from the `safeoutputs` MCP server.

Do not use GitHub tools. The assign_to_agent tool will handle the actual assignment.
